This dashboard visualizes four possible states for each radiator and device, as well as a separate state for extra-long radiators with multiple devices. The dashboard allows users to visualize whichever of these states is desired. If desires the user can also choose to see all units (apartments) and spaces (rooms and common areas) regardless of whether they have any of the selected radiators.

This project was created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and [Material UI](https://www.material-ui.com).
